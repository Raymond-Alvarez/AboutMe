            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I’m <strong>Raymond</strong>, a creative problem-solver currently transitioning into the world of Software Development. I have a professional background in
                navigating complex needs and empowering individuals, where I specialized in crafting personalized solutions to support others on their journey.</p>
            
            <p>That experience taught me the value of efficiency, root-cause analysis, and clear communication—tools I’ve carried with me into development to ensure the solutions I 
                build are as intentional as they are functional. I’m focused on continuous growth and building a community of fellow innovators. 

            <p>My goal is to merge my background in professional development with modern technology to create tools that genuinely move the needle for others. I’m a firm believer 
                that technology should be as approachable as a good conversation, and I’m genuinely excited to put these tools to work and make an impact on this coding 
                adventure.</p>
