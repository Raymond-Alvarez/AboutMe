            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I’m <strong>Raymond</strong>, a creative problem-solver currently transitioning into the world of Software Development. I have a professional background 
               in navigating complex needs and empowering individuals, where I specialized in crafting personalized solutions to support others on their journey.</p>
            
            <p>That experience taught me the value of efficiency, root-cause analysis, and clear communication—tools I’ve carried with me into development to ensure the solutions 
               I build are as intentional as they are functional.</p>

            <p>I’m a firm believer that technology should be as approachable as a good conversation. I am genuinely excited to put my background to work and make an impact as this 
               coding adventure continues to unfold.</p>
